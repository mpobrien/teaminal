This is a terminal screen sharing server + web based client. It allows you to stream your terminal
session to a remote server so anyone you share a URL with can view (and also type into) your terminal.

It also contains an implementation of a VT100 compatible terminal emulator with support for unicode and 256 colors.

It's built with javascript and python.

It's incomplete and still has bugs.
